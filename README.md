# BattleField4_PuzzleSolution
BF4 has an ingame easter egg which involves a step where you need to find the correct combination of 7 buttons to press so that all 20 lamps are lit. Each button connects to a random set of lamps that needs to be found manually. This code finds out the combination in which the buttons need to be pressed for all lamps to light up.
